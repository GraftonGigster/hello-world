Hello world, my name is Grafton.  In Gaelic, "Grafton" means "Son of the Duke".  In Old English, it means "Grove Town".  Take your pick, at least it's not "SOB".

I am a software and information systems engineering generalist with 30+ years of real-time, transactional, batch, and web systems development, debugging, refactoring, optimization, documentation, deployment and maintenance, globally.
